# Project state

## Thesis

Automatically infer enough observable dependencies of an unmodified Linux process to reuse computation safely, and enforce that safety when enforcement is available. Fail closed.

## Safety invariants

- `UNKNOWN` and `NONDETERMINISTIC` never reuse.
- `EMPIRICALLY_STABLE` does not reuse in V1.
- `PROVEN` requires seccomp plus Landlock ABI 3+ actually installed. Observation alone is not `PROVEN`.
- Guards finish before cached output is exposed.
- Writable file-backed `MAP_SHARED` mappings are `UNKNOWN`. vDSO clock reads are not observed.
- `Guard::NoUnexpectedEffects` always passes. Classification is the real rejection.
- Uncertainty fails closed.

## Architecture

`effects -> guards -> cache -> trace -> sandbox -> core -> cli`

Linux x86_64. ptrace. BLAKE3 CAS. SQLite. Whole-command reuse. Strict hashing. Synchronous guards. Deoptimize and retrace after invalidation. No daemon.

## Validated capabilities

- CI on `main` has formatted, clippy-checked, and tested the workspace. Re-run it after the documentation and explain/doctor changes in this working tree. They have not been through GitHub Actions yet.
- Adversarial fixtures and `linux_integration` cover guarded hit, restore, replay, and deopt. Those tests are Linux-only and were not re-run on the macOS machine that edited the docs.
- This tree is 0.1.1. `explain` prints a dependency summary. `doctor` names an unsupported OS. Writable shared file mappings are `UNKNOWN`. The published v0.1.0 binary has none of those changes.

## Benchmark status

Do not replace these with local guesses.

Kept loss, commit `63e33638709aacfaed896ab587435e64c0ecea62`: C ETL baseline 7.396 ms, cache hit 7.957 ms (0.929468x). See `benchmarks/results/latest.md`.

After the hit-path change, commit `e9684c1c01a7bbbab4cae50e2389105596d613f1`: `c-transform` baseline 312.913 ms, hit 3.972 ms, 78.780x. That workload is synthetic (`EXTRA_ROUNDS` is 250000000). Slowest measured loss 1.796 ms, fastest measured win 5.274 ms. Shell and `cc -c` stayed `UNKNOWN`. Python stayed `NONDETERMINISTIC` (`getrandom`, `gettid`). See `benchmarks/results/break-even.md`.

## Release

v0.1.0 is already a public GitHub Release. Do not move that tag. 0.1.1 is prepared and not published. Do not publish it without explicit approval and a green Linux CI run on this commit.

## Blockers before a public announcement of this tree

- Commit and push this tree, then wait until Linux CI is green, including `./scripts/demo.sh`.
- Native Linux CI has not yet run on this commit. Do not announce until it has.
- Shell, `cc`, and CPython remain refused. That is correct until a fixture says otherwise.

## Known-good benchmark commits

`e9684c1c01a7bbbab4cae50e2389105596d613f1` for the transform and the sweep. `63e33638709aacfaed896ab587435e64c0ecea62` for the published short-command loss.

## Validation still required on Linux

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo test -p tracejit-cli --test linux_integration -- --nocapture
cargo build --workspace --release
./scripts/demo.sh
```
