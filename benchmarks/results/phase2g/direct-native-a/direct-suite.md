Workloads: 16 (denominator fixed; refusals stay in it)
Reused on the second run: 1/16
Traced output matched a direct run: 16/16

## gzip
- classification Guarded, eligible True, reused True, second decision Reused
- direct exit 0, traced exit 0, stdout matches True
- reasons: all observed dependencies are guardable or captured outputs
- timing: direct 28.98 ms, cached 4.42 ms, cold 44.69 ms, 6.56x, 0.64 hits to repay

## bzip2
- classification Nondeterministic, eligible False, reused False, second decision Ineligible
